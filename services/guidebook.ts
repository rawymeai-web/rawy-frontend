            pronounPolicyGuard: "Pronoun Policy Guard (ages 1–5): the final text must not use third-person pronouns (he/she/him/her/his/hers/it/its) to refer to the hero or a named companion. Use the name, or restructure the sentence to avoid needing a pronoun at all (e.g. drop possessive by using an article: instead of 'She held her soft pebble' -> 'Lana wiggled, happy, holding a soft pebble'). Do not achieve 'no pronouns' by repeating the name awkwardly."
