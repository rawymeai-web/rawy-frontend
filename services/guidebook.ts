            recurringDeviceRule: "State the simple physical trigger of any anchor item on first use in Spread 1. Always state cause before effect.",
            objectContinuityRule: "For ages 1–5, maintain object continuity by using the hero's name possessive ('Lana's pebble') instead of generic articles ('a pebble') which create discontinuity.",
            helperAnimalPurpose: "When introducing a mentor or helper animal (e.g. owl, turtle), explicitly describe what they embody ('slow and calm') so downstream callbacks feel earned.",

            transitionAndResolution: "Bridging clauses required when crossing setting boundaries or returning home.",
            themePremiseAlignment: "Explicitly dramatize the core theme promise (e.g. quiet animal language).",
            emotionalVocabulary: "For ages 1-3, use simple primary emotions (happy, sad, mad, calm, proud, scared, mixed up, safe). Save complex emotions (frustrated, disappointed) for older tiers.",
            bannedWordPolicy: "If a banned or overly complex word must be replaced, preserve the story beat it was carrying using an approved substitute from SIMPLE_WORD_REPLACEMENT_DICTIONARY — never delete the beat itself.",
            pronounPolicyGuard: "Pronoun Policy Guard (ages 1–5): the final text must not use third-person pronouns (he/she/him/her/his/hers/it/its) to refer to the hero or a named companion. Use the hero's name, or restructure sentences naturally without ungrammatical fragments."
